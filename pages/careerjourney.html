			<p> As Marketing Coordinator at the University of Alabama, my writing was more education based creating brochures, press release, and media kit messages for early child care centers and parents. I created and implemented marketing plans to generate awareness about our departmentâ€™s health and educational initiatives. This included but was not limited to email marketing, press kits to media outlets, newsletters, project budget costs and more. I also was tasked with being liaison between the University and government agencies on collaborative health and education initiatives.
